Description: Cohort plAtform Trial Simulation whereby every cohort consists of two arms, 
             control and experimental treatment. Endpoints are co-primary binary endpoints and
             decisions are made using either Bayesian or frequentist decision rules. 
             Realistic trial trajectories are simulated and the operating characteristics of the 
             designs are calculated.
