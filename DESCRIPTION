Description: A collection of functions dedicated to simulating staggered entry platform 
    trials whereby the treatment under investigation is a combination of two 
    active compounds. In order to obtain approval for this combination therapy,
    superiority of the combination over the two active compounds and superiority
    of the two active compounds over placebo need to be demonstrated. 
    A more detailed description of the design can be found in 
    Meyer et al. <arXiv:2103.09547>.
